# ML-cnn-greek_alphabet
* The aim of this project was to train a nerual network that would classify an image as one of 24 greek alphabet letters. 
* In the jupyter notebook I trained the network using **Tensorflow**.
* In the python file there is a simple app to draw letters and let the network classify it.
